filmical
========

A simple program that produces an ical feed of upcoming UK film releases.

Why?
----

Because I couldn't find one. And I thought it would be useful. There are
more details in
[this blog post](http://blog.dave.org.uk/2014/01/uk-film-releases.html).

Where does the data come from?
------------------------------

Currently, I parse a text file (films.txt) that is also in this repository.
I should probably be a little cleverer than that.

As for where the actual data comes from... well, I typed it in manually
after going through the latest copy of [Empire](http://www.empireonline.com/).

Where is the feed?
------------------

The feed is available at
[http://dave.org.uk/ukfilmrel.ics](http://dave.org.uk/ukfilmrel.ics).
I've also built [a page](http://dave.org.uk/films) that is
driven by the feed.

Where is the code?
------------------

On [Github](http://gitbub.com) of course.

More specifically, at
